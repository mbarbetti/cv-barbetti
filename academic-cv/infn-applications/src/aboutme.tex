\section*{About Me}
\begin{cvcontent}
  I am a third year Ph.D. student in Smart Computing at the 
  University of Florence. My research activity is mainly 
  dedicated to the development of \emph{Lamarr} 
  \ref{item:lamarr-ichep}, the new LHCb ultra-fast 
  simulation framework. Lamarr consists of a pipeline 
  of modular parameterizations designed to replace both 
  the physics simulation and the reconstruction steps.
  Most of the parameterizations rely on Machine Learning 
  algorithms \ref{item:gan-pm}, such as \emph{generative
  models} that have proven to be able to well reproduce 
  the detailed simulation \ref{item:gan-acat}. As active 
  developer for the LHCb Simulation Project, I am responsible
  
  
  
  
  %Once trained, the models are ready to be integrated with the LHCb software stack \ref{item:scikinc}.
